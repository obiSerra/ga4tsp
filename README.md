# Genetic Algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem

This script is a simple and light implementation of a Genetic Algorithm in to solve the famous Travelling Salesman Problem. 
It is done in vanilla Javascript, and it uses a canvas to visualize the result and to interact with the user.



To see the running demo please go to  [http://obiserra.github.io/ga4tsp/](http://obiserra.github.io/ga4tsp/)


**Note:** *A genetic algorithm is not the optimal way to takle a problem like the TSP, this is just a way to play with basic machine learning and vanilla js ;)*
